# NÅ‘kl - The hub for game developers to connect and share!
> My June-July Portfolio Initiative Fullstack Web App 2 -> Game dev hub for game devs and enthusiasts. Will use Nextjs and TailwindCSS for frontend | Prisma ORM PostgreSQL for backend.

Technologies:
- Nextjs
  |- Built-In Routing
  |- Packaged with TailwindCSS
  |- NextAuth (might replace with a custom Authentitcation system in the future, but right now, setting up NextAuth is faster and safer)

- PostgreSQL
  (need to think about the routes)


To Do (from da top)

User Authentitcation (JWT)
- make new branch for that
...
